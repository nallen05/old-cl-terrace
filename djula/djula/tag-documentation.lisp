Devel dictionaries must be filled with key/val pairs where the keys are lisp keywords
mapping to variables and the values are lisp objects [strings, numbers, lists, plists,

(def-tag-documentation :if '(var)
"The {% if %} tag evaluates a variable, and if that variable is 'true' (i.e. exists, is
not empty, and is not a false boolean value) the contents of the block are output:

   {% if athlete_list %}
       Number of athletes: {{ athlete_list|length }}
   {% else %}
       No athletes.
   {% endif %}

In the above, if `athlete_list' is not empty, the number of athletes will be displayed
by the {{ athlete_list|length }} variable.

As you can see, the if tag can take an optional {% else %} clause that will be
displayed if the test fails.

if tags may use and, or or not to test a number of variables or to negate a given
variable:

   {% if athlete_list and coach_list %}
       Both athletes and coaches are available.
   {% endif %}

   {% if not athlete_list %}
       There are no athletes.
   {% endif %}

   {% if athlete_list or coach_list %}
       There are some athletes or some coaches.
   {% endif %}

   {% if not athlete_list or coach_list %}
       There are no athletes or there are some coaches (OK, so
       writing English translations of boolean logic sounds
       stupid; it's not our fault).
   {% endif %}

   {% if athlete_list and not coach_list %}
       There are some athletes and absolutely no coaches.
   {% endif %}

if tags donâ€™t allow and and or clauses within the same tag, because the order of logic
would be ambiguous. For example, this is invalid:

   {% if athlete_list and coach_list or cheerleader_list %}

If you need to combine and and or to do advanced logic, just use nested if tags. For
example:

   {% if athlete_list %}
      {% if coach_list or cheerleader_list %}
         We have athletes, and either coaches or cheerleaders!
      {% endif %}
   {% endif %}

Multiple uses of the same logical operator are fine, as long as you use the same
operator. For example, this is valid:

   {% if athlete_list or coach_list or parent_list or teacher_list %}"
:from-django-p t)

(def-tag-documentation :ifchanged '(&rest vars)
"Check if a value has changed from the last iteration of a loop.

The â€˜ifchangedâ€™ block tag is used within a loop. It has two possible uses.

Checks its own rendered contents against its previous state and only displays the
content if it has changed. For example, this displays a list of days, only displaying
the month if it changes:

   <h1>Archive for {{ year }}</h1>

   {% for date in days %}
      {% ifchanged %}<h3>{{ date|date:\"F\" }}</h3>{% endifchanged %}
         <a href=\"{{ date|date:\"M/d\"|lower }}/\">{{ date|date:\"j\" }}</a>
   {% endfor %}

If given a variable, check whether that variable has changed. For example, the
following shows the date every time it changes, but only shows the hour if both the
hour and the date has changed:

   {% for date in days %}
      {% ifchanged date.date %} {{ date.date }} {% endifchanged %}

Example:

As in the {% if %} tag, an {% else %} clause is optional.

The arguments can be hard-coded strings, so the following is valid:

   {% ifequal user.username \"adrian\" %}
      ...
   {% endifequal %}

It is only possible to compare an argument to template variables or strings. You cannot
check for equality with Lisp objects such as T or NIL. If you need to test if
something is true or false, use the if tag instead."
